# That's what she said classifier. (H2)
Date : July 1, 2012

This project is a small "That's what she said" generator.
It can take an input file and output the sentences that are most likely to be that's what she said jokes
This is based on the idea from [Edwin Chen's blog](http://blog.echen.me/) that I wanted to try to create
myself to learn how naive bayes works.

Goals:
* Learn the logic behind naive bayes and why it works.
* Create a meaningful application of naive bayes.
* Continue improving my pythonic coding.
